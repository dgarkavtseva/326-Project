# Application Name

Rename the above with the name of your application.

# Overview

The purpose of our application is to serve as a platform to allow UMass students to order grab and go to be delivered by other students that are looking to make money. The idea is based off of Uber Eats, but designed to be a more personalized platform for UMass students only, specific to UMass dining locations. 
The application will be used to order and deliver food, specifically grab and go, from UMass dining halls to students. Other students will deliver the food and make money by doing so.
The primary users are UMass students. Students with meal plan will be the ones to deliver the food, while all students who do not want to or donâ€™t have time to go to dining halls will order the food.

# Application Initialization

To use this application you should have `node` and `npm` installed and issue the following commands:

1. `npm install`: this will install the required `node` libraries.
2. `npm run watch`: this will compile the application code and produce an `App.js` file in the `static` directory. This command will also continue to run until explicitly killed (e.g., control-C).
3. `npm start`: this will run the Express server, `server.js`, allowing you to view the running application in the browser window.
